 How's it going everybody? Welcome back and let's talk about onMount, which happens to be one of the most frequently used lifecycle hooks in Svelte. So as you see, this is code that we've seen before, right? This input HTML element is getting bound to the input variable. and what happens if we want this style change to take place right on the page load or maybe better said when the dom is ready if i just put it down here it's not going to work we are going to get an error i just saved and as you see nothing is now showing on the screen and that is because we are trying to manipulate this element before it has been properly bound to the variable all right and we can actually hook in to the exact time that the dom is ready by using the lifecycle hook on mount so this is wildly useful i'm going to go in here and i'm going to import on mount from Svelte. Perfect. I'm going to put this down here. All right. And let's go ahead and pass in an arrow function. And I'm just going to move this down here. Awesome. So we can guarantee that input has been properly bound. It is ready to go. And then we are making that change. There are so many use cases for on mount, and it's going to really serve you well by adding this to your arsenal in Svelte. So I hope this helped. If it did, go ahead, give us a thumbs up, and I will see you in the next one.
