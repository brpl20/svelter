 well so the idea here is I want to kind of like you know just get people into Svelte and see how they can get started and show that as well so if you've joined late who am I so my name is Ilesh Mistry I'm a CMS specialist and the content MVP you can kind of contact me using the QR code on the right so the bits I'm going to be covering is a sort of like quick introduction about Svelte how to get started show you some of their examples which are really cool and easy to kind of get going with and I'll show you a quick demo of sourcing data from a headless CMS which I think is sometimes an opportunity to bring data into an application then we'll look at some spout takeaways as well from that so What is Svel? So it's basically a JavaScript enhanced sort of like application development framework. It's similar to this component frameworks that you would normally use like React and Vue. One of the key things I find as well is like with Svelte is that you generally end up writing less code compared to the other frameworks. And I'm just going to flick over to an example of this so the example component at the top shows you two text boxes and what you're doing is a simple sort of like addition of that so as soon as you type in some numbers in there it will add those items up and show you the results so you've got three sort of images and hopefully they're coming okay on the screen share but on the left hand side or basically you start with react and that's probably one of the popular frameworks out there and you can see the number of lines of codes you probably would need to use and if you go further across you've got view okay yes and that's a little bit sort of less as well but soon as you move over to swelter you see like that is like like reducing the amount of code like massively and you know there is a blog post at the bottom of the slide there that talks more about this but you can see that like if you're trying to pick up Svelte or like learn it seems like a very easier option to kind of pick this up quite quickly and then start rolling with it to go more on with Svelte so it's basically a tool for building fast web applications one of the key things is the fact that build time is what it really tries to kind of incorporate so rather than actually building your application on say runtime you tend to do it on build time so it's before the application is starts and it's then prides itself with the node for virtual DOM as well with it the state management there's not like it's not very it's not complex and and it's mainly based on being like truly reactive and it's written by rich Harris at the start and then it's like massively open source like is open for like lots of contributors and some of these guys are already going to be talking about this later as well and it also powers an application framework called SAPA so more information about this because we've got two talks already on this later so I'm sure the guys will kind of talk a little bit about that as well so I guess I could talk about like how I got started with this so Svelte is something that was quite new to me it was mentioned by one of my colleagues and I decided to have a look so the key thing for me or the key starting point for me was to look on their website and there's a great tutorial on that and easy to follow steps and to get started with that. And then the other thing which I'll show you in a bit as well is that the website itself has examples area and for me like if I go to other websites I don tend to see this really it more like a code pen style format so you can actually see examples with their results and also tweak those you know examples to to try things out another thing I've started to do as well is to go to the discord chat room to ask questions as well because they've got a great community out there and I'd heavily recommend to do that if you're looking to kind of like listen to further talks there's the Svelte summit on October 18th so that's something to look out for and I just feel like it if you want to get started it's worth like getting involved in meetups and events like this it really helps so for the Svelte example so I'm just gonna flick off the slide deck one second and then the examples themselves what we've got is like there's a lot of things that they show and you can see here a simple example of just the hello world on there but you know you can see how the word itself can be sort of like added into the prop here and then added into there and you can see and change things as well as you like they've got elements here that show you how to kind to change images and good old Rick Astley is there and then we've got other ones as well so for example if I look at say nested components you can see that then you can start bringing in other files of information so what you can notice here is that the initial sort of file is you know sort of extended with salt but what you can see here is that I could go to the nested file here and you can see it's already coming up on this screen on the right hand side but the idea is it will bring it across on this side and Swell also does things where the styling is kind of in-house as well so in that page or in that sort of area that you're creating items on so it keeps it very sort of like component based as well the other things that you could probably look at is you know as you go along with these some examples there's a lot here that you can see that can help later on when you start like building complex functionality but you get reactive elements in here there's things about proper props so you can kind of start changing things and then there's also things where you can start like going into the if-else containers and things and then also let's see if I can find the other one I was going to show you've got things where you got binding so you can kind of like incorporate some elements in there and also you've got things where you can do like you know normal things that you would normally expect on a form but be able to kind of do it quite quickly and see those things on there I think as well there's also the each block and then the model so let's go and find some of those but the idea is that you get a a lot of things here that you can start like I'm thinking about so I've been on many projects when the clients actually said hey like or or even though the requirement is can you have something that can allow you to just add something and remove some you know add another field add another item or another item and this is quite cool like you know just like the functionality that you can say okay well you can clear things out but these are like sort of like we can understand that these are like more simpler examples that can be then extended to complex scenarios and then I guess I can show you just one final one from here which is quite a funny one let's see if I can find it here we go so everybody loves cats right so here we go hello goodbye but basically like you can see that you can do a lot of stuff here and this is more to do with actually the body manipulation side of things but you can see what what's awesome what's it capable of as well Okay so I going to click back to the slides okay so my next thing really to show is like we can see that there lots of examples out there on how to you know bring in content or utilize content or utilize data basically the data is kind of the key thing here so I'm going to use I'll show you an example of actually sourcing from a headless CMS and this one's called Kentico content and what we've got there is a few sort of like get started pointers so you obviously would clone the repository from the sample template to MPM install and then you'll have to register with Kentico content so that's just a separate step you need to do and it's very easy to do that and then once you've created the project you kind of have to enable the API configuration and once that's done then you start putting in sort of like the sample content in there and then you can run the application so if I flick back over to there so let's go to source and I'll bring up also content so just reload that so this is Kentico content and within here you'll see lots of things here basically just a headless CMS it's got items in there now if I wanted to sort of like utilize and change something on my codebase let's see if we can run this so I'm just going to run the app so in this case we need to do npm run build and then I'm just going to run the actual safer application once I've done that I'm just going to reload my page and this is basically just a very simple site that's been created but In particular, what we've done is we've, on the author section, we've bought in the headless CMS data from the CMS Kentico content and populated these items in here. So just to quickly show you this, so for example, a starter for avocado and mango salsa. If I go into here, you can see that that's probably, that's the actual one that it is. And you can see the information here that, so the idea here is now like, If I was something like giving this to a client or something, I could probably get them to say, okay, let's ask you to start making changes. So we can go ahead and amend the price. Let's go for 13, 14 pounds. And let's say we've got peppers in here as well. I'm just gonna publish this. And flip back to my app, and I'll probably just need to restart it. so get that back running and reload the page and may need to do another reload sorry you can see here that that's now amended to $14 with the information there so what I'm really trying show you here is that you can still create a small application that can be fed in from a headless CMS and allows that sort of content items of it can be driven elsewhere and it doesn't have to be sort of like and if you imagine like what is actually returned in the end from this and headless CMS is it's basically a JSON file so if you imagine consuming that so if we go back to the code can show you that quickly is that's where we're sort of getting the actual JSON file. Once you've got that then we end up adding some styling to the page itself. And then it a simple sort of like each statement to kind of go through the categories and the items and display them in the in the actual format that we want it to be displayed so hopefully you can see that you know it very simple to kind of get used to using Svelte it's one of the ways that you can kind of incorporate a headless CMS into it but in the end it's data so whether that's a headless CMS or something else like a JSON file that can just be coming in from somewhere else as well okay just gonna flick back to the presentation okay so that was kind of the main bit I wanted to kind of show and here are some swell takeaways so for me one of the biggest things I'm hoping that if you do take away anything from this is you know you you end up writing less code and imagine that can save like performance on sort of like when you're building the code before and before runtime it will hopefully make the application load faster as well on first load I feel that the community is you know driving this a lot as well so it's really good I showed earlier how easy it is to kind of build your own sort of small SAPA app and it's easy to know and I feel that if anything you know if you got any questions then please you know join the discord chat chat room as well and then I guess like a finer point is to show that obviously you know you can use data from anything and I just you an example of how to bring this across from a headless CMS okay so that's it from me if you've got any questions just pop them on the group chat and I've got a little sort of thing on the right just to make sure that if anybody wants to register with Kentico content there's a 90 days free trial as well and they can use that link to there so I'll just wait for like a minute or so to see if there's any questions coming in or you can unmute yourselves so I had a question sorry okay sure yeah and I don't know whether you'll know the answer to it but obviously as someone that's quite interested in JavaScript frameworks and I like trying to apply them on big accounts where where I can with clients something that's quite important is I mean you mentioned an active community is there like a big companies that back this like obviously react have Facebook angular dare I say it has as Google and just felt have anything so the the sort of like clearest answer I could could probably give is if I go and click over to their website and go to their home page they've got a number of clients at the bottom of this So who's using them? So here's, I guess, your answer. There's a couple of biggish clients there, but yeah, this is probably where you would probably need to find out where if there's a client that suits the requirements, like Philips is massive as well. So there's quite a lot of companies in there. Cool. I can help out with that question. I think, yeah, you see in the list GoDaddy. I think they also have like Apple that is looking for Svelte developers already. And yeah, there's a couple of other ones that are just not listed here yet because I don't think this was updated in quite a while. Thanks. Cool. Thanks, Marcus. Okay. Any other questions before we move to the next presentation? Okay, so I guess
