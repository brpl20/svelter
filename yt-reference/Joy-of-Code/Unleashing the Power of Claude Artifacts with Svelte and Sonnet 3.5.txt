 Hello everyone! So just a couple days ago Anthropic released a new feature called Projects and Artifacts and it's basically a new way to interactively build stuff with code inside the browser and an enterprising member of the Svelte community has actually built a way to use it with Svelte so I thought that we'd check it out now and maybe build some interactive games with Svelte. Alright, so while Claude Artifacts works with React and HTML and stuff like that, it doesn't work with Svelte. That's why we need this script that a member of the Svelte community developed. So, it's under this repo. His name is Socripon, and I'm gonna send a link to it in the video description. and once you have tampermonkey installed which is an extension that you can get for firefox or chrome then you have to install this script and there's some instructions here on how to do it once you got that done all you have to do is go to the claude website and we can already start prompting so i don't know let's do something fun here let's maybe ask Claude to make a pawn game in the Svelte let's see how that goes all right and now it's gonna it's gonna think for a little bit and generate some code here for us and what this extension is gonna do is actually allow us to run this code in the browser and see the results. Let's see if that works. All right it looks very good already so it correctly opened up the Svelte REPL. I see here that the thing is working. I can actually see it. I don't see the whole game but I can like decrease the size of the viewport a little bit. It might be a little small to see the text but you can see the game. Wow it even looks like it added some sort of AI to the game. It looks like it's a little bit buggy. Let's see here, we'll restart it. So it looks like there's even an AI here that I can play against. And so what's cool about this artifacts feature is that I can continue to iterate on this So let say that I go back and I say this is great but let make the background green instead and make the ball an emoji Also improve the ball physics because they are a little bit buggy. So let's see what it does with that. Alright, so it did some changes. It replaced the ball with the emoji for a racket. Okay, not quite correct, but definitely something. And you can see it corrected the background color as I asked it. So yeah, I think very cool. So we can see here that we can both build and interact with things. Let's try something else. Maybe let's try. Can you build a simplified version of Flappy Bird as a single svelte file? Let's see how that goes. All right, so it generated the code, but the extension, it's not always perfect. Sometimes it doesn't paste the coding correctly. so I'm just gonna go ahead and reload this conversation and click on the click on the artifact again and then it works okay so let's see here so what happened I just immediately fell to my death here I guess I have to yeah I have to... oh look at this it's fantastic so I'm actually playing Flappy Bird now and that was just like from one prompt and I can preview it live in my browser. All right so great okay I see one bug here that the doesn't seem to collide with the with the pipes yeah so I'm gonna ask Claude to fix that great but the pipes do not seem to have any collision with the plate There we go And now let see if the collision with the pipes is working Yes it is working fantastic All right let have a look at the code it generated So what's cool about this is this is sort of idiomatic Svelte code. It didn't just like write the JavaScript library and then connect it up to Svelte. It kind of uses Svelte reactivity here by defining variables. There's going to be reactive. It created an update function that runs on every frame. It checks the collisions. It adds pipes randomly. So you know, and I would say this code is very simple, so very easy also to iterate on. So I think that's a two for two for Claude the new artifacts function so one thing that i also wanted to show you was this um projects feature so we saw artifacts and now we're checking out projects so projects does is it allows you to kind of have a separate space with conversations that that have a type of context so to this context you can add project knowledge and actually what i've done here is i've downloaded all of the SvelteKit documentation and I've put it into a JSON file or rather there is a JSON file that you can download I can send you a link to that and I've just uploaded this documentation into the project knowledge and I've made this prompt that says to always use the project knowledge to always write in TypeScript to use a package JSON file if one is uploaded to the project knowledge and now Claude can actually do really good SvelteKit stuff. So if you have tried using AI with Svelte sometimes it doesn't work 100% because SvelteKit has evolved and sometimes you get old code and stuff. So for example let's ask it to write something simple. Write a SvelteKit page with a counter. The counter uses a form action to save the current count to a SQLite database. So this already requires knowledge about SvelteKit, how the structure should be, about form actions Let see how it does All right so what happens when you have the project knowledge is that it takes a little bit longer for it to process because it has to go through the project knowledge Alright so it tells us to install betterSk and then it correctly gave us an example of a plus page.svelte. So correctly got the page data here. Let me make that a little bit bigger so it correctly gave us the page data it moved count here into data.count it's using use enhance it created two form actions increment and decrement and let's see on the page server files it's even it's great initializing the database and it's even executing a table migration if we haven't created one a table yet and then the load function correctly fetches the data from the database and it has also correctly implemented the update methods. Because we're using useEnhance that's gonna correctly reload the data. I can actually even ask why is it enough to just use use enhance here instead of getting the form data. That's a very deep knowledge that it has to dig into the documentation to figure out. Alright so here it says after successful form submission use enhance automatically invalidates all data on the page. It will rerun load function to fetch fresh data from the server which in our case will get updated counter value. This is fantastic. So as you see this is really really cool. So all you really need to do is create a project, a cloud project and upload all the documentation for the libraries you're using and write a little bit in the instructions of the type of code you wanted to give you. It's gonna be really really good, really really powerful at generating just the right type of code for your project. So I hope you liked that short video giving you a little bit of an introduction to Claude the projects and artifacts and what it can do for your Svelte programming. So just let me know if you liked the video and let me know if you want any other topics to be discussed on the channel. Thanks so much for watching!
