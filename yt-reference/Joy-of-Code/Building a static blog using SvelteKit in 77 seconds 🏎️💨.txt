 How do I build a static page in SvelteKit and how do I fetch data from a remote CMS, like a headless CMS? All right, so what I have here is a blog. When I go to the first blog, it shows the post. When I go to the second blog, it goes to the second blog. Let's go over and break down how I got this to render. So under my example site, under routes, we have blog and then we have post. But on the homepage, we have this page.svelte and it uses export-lit data to cycle through each blog post. So in the companion page, .server.js, we have a load and run pnpm run build. There you go. Static HTML with a hyperlink to the first blog post. Second blog, same story. We have the second blog and the paragraph. SvelteKit, when it builds, it crawls all the hyperlinks. So the hyperlinks get generated from this page. SvelteKit follows slash blog slash slug. And then it calls the respective server.js file to load the endpoint. So these dynamic routes have an endpoint to fetch the individual blog posts, which SvelteKit also traverses. I'll show you my SvelteConfig. There's really nothing special about it. See, I'm using AdapterStatic. It is possible to configure the crawler to prerender particular routes. I did not have to do that because the homepage route generates hyperlinks and those hyperlinks get crawled automatically. Okay.
