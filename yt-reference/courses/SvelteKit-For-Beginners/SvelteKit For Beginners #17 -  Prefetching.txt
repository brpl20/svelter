 Welcome back friends. The bittersweet moment of our journey nearing its end. But it's not over yet, we have a couple of more things to talk about. So let's talk about prefetching. So currently our site is awesome, but it could be even more awesome. So for example, currently how the navigation feels to me is, let's see, so we're on home, and if you go on profile it's like, and then it's like, and then it's, so can we make this snappier? And the answer is yes we can thanks to code splitting. so we can add prefetching to the page meaning when a user hovers over a link is going to start already getting the assets that it needs right and this is really possible to code splitting which is awesome so let's just add this and it's nothing complicated it's really a couple of lines of code right so we can go to navigation cell press ctrl p in your editor and go to navigation cell and Then let's add it for home. Here is home. And to add prefetching, we say, SwelltKit Prefetch And then we need to add it for the rest of the links right so you can say swell keep prefetch and let see yeah there just so okay prefetch and let let's well get fetch awesome so let's save this and that's how simple that was we're already done sorry to disappoint you nothing convoluted in this one so let me just open the network type to show you how this works and you know me I'm always paranoid so let's just refresh it. So yeah, so we're on home and let's see what happens when we hover over the profile. So pay attention to the network tab. Oh, enough with the tomfoolery. So instead of that creaking sound when you're navigating your page, our users are going to have a more delightful experience because that 300 milliseconds is all the difference in the world. So let me just go to home. just refresh for good measures and then let's try navigating now and you can see how much snappier this is look at this and this is really awesome and the power of prefetching so see you in the next one
