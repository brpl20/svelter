 Hey friends, welcome to Fullstack Swellkit for beginners. So in this series we're going to be learning how to make fullstack applications using Swellkit. And we're going to be making Twitter a social media site for sharing hot takes. So if I go here to the landing page we can see this beautiful animation. And here's our feed so we can share our hot take. We can like it. We can go to the permalink. We can go back. We can remove it. There's also a profile. The settings page. and about. Let's go back to home and I'm going to zoom in because this is the responsive view. So this is going to be an awesome and fun project to learn everything about SwellKit and how awesome it is to build this type of user experiences. So the only thing you're going to need is you're going to go to this project from the link in the post and you're going to download the project so you can clone it if you want. The only thing you need is from the static folder you can get all these images and you can just paste it over and that's it. So let's get started. Thank you.
