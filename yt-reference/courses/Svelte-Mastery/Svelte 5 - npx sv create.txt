 Hi everyone, so in this video we're going to look at how to start your first Svelte 5 project. So there's a new command line tool called SV that you can run with npx sv and then we're going to do create and I'm going to call it practice. So here you probably want to just do minimal or demo if you want to learn more about SvelteKit. I would suggest using TypeScript and then I personally like Tailwind and I'm using spacebar here, space, and I would definitely do ESLint and Prettier. And skip that. And then here, if you do have a preference, you can choose one of these. Otherwise, I would just use npm. Okay, great. So now you can just change directory into that project and open it in your VS Code Editor and there you go. Bye-bye.
