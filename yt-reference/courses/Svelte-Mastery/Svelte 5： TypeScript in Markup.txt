 Hey everyone, welcome back. And now that Svelte 5 is officially here, we have native TypeScript support in our markup, which is huge. Because if you've ever used Svelte 4, you know this is a major pain point. And so I'm in Vercel's blog here. This is kind of like an announcement post. And real quick, shout out to Vercel because they employ Rich Harris, Dominic, Simon, and they're just really helping us push the framework forward. So thanks, Vercel. Now let's go ahead and read just a bit of this. Svelte 5 introduces native TypeScript support. Previous versions used a preprocessor, which added moving parts. Native TypeScript support means faster builds and the ability to use TypeScript annotations directly in your Svelte markup. So that's awesome. And let's just take a quick example at this or take a look at an example. Now I'm just going to use a type assertion just like this using the keyword as and I'm going to type this as an HTML input element and as you see we're all set our errors go away now this is implicitly typed as any so we can go ahead and add a type annotation and we are all set so we are good to go and this right here is a snippet which is new to spell 5 I have a video on that this is super powerful and I just can't wait to explore all the ways that I can use this. So I hope this was helpful. If it was, go ahead and give us a thumbs up and I will see you in the next one.
