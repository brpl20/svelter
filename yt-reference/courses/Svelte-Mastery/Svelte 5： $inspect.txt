 Hey everyone, welcome back and let's quickly talk about the inspect rune that we have available in Svelte 5. So essentially it's like a console.log statement except it's reactive, which is really nice. So when any of these values change, so if I increment, you're going to see those changes, or if I go ahead and change the value here, it's going to log those values. Now if we take a quick trip to the docs here, take a look at how awesome this is. inspect only works during development. So you know those log statements that you kind of want to keep in your code, but you really don't want to be displayed in the browser? Well, the inspect rune is pretty much the answer to this. And what's really nice is it allows us not only to run this in development, which is already a win, but we don't have to do stuff like this. We don't have to create an effect and then console.log, which we really just kind of want to use these sparingly. And at the end of the day, we used to do this in Svelte 4 with kind of a reactive statement, right? So console.log and then just passing in count and message. So we used to work with something like this, but now since we're not using the reactive statement anymore, we're going to use the inspect rune. So it's just a really safe way to grab those values when they change. Now, if we go ahead and take a look at the docs a little bit further, you're going to see that we can use .with and throw in a callback function if you want a little bit of more like hands-on control. But normally, just using that inspect rune just kind of as is right out of the box is probably what you'll end up needing. So I hope you got something out of this. If you did, go ahead and give us a thumbs up, and I will see you in the next one.
