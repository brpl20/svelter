 How's it going, everybody? Welcome back, and let's talk about derived values in Svelte. So this is just code we've seen before, and I'm going to add a variable price, and we are going to assign that to five. Now, what I'm also going to do is I'm also going to create a total variable, and I'm going to assign that to fruits.length times price. Now, this is not going to work, but we have to kind of look at this example, work this example to fully understand this. All right. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to put it at the bottom here, and let's do just a quick h1 tag and i'm going to put total i save this and you see 15 there are three elements the length is going to return three and we're going to times that by five which is the price now what happens is i going to remove a fruit and here we are still stuck with 15 we want to see 10 right now we want to see five Now we want to see 0 But that not necessarily happening And that is because we need to tell the compiler of Svelte that total is a derived value. And the way we can do this is it's really simple. And we're going to do dollar sign colon. That is it. That fixes everything, which is awesome. So take a look at this. All right, remove one. Now we're at 10. Now we're at five. Now we're at zero. So whenever you see this dollar sign in Svelte, you know something magical is going to happen. So this dollar sign is called a label. And it's not really useful in a lot of cases, so it got repurposed here. And whenever you see a dollar sign, it means something special is really going to happen in Svelte. And here we have it. This is all we need to properly create a derived value. All right. Hope this helped. If it helped, go ahead and give it a thumbs up, and I will see you in the next one.
