 How's it going everybody? Welcome back and let's talk about rendering raw HTML in Svelte. So as you see here, I have an ht element as a string and if you're just trying to get it on the screen just by using the curly brackets, you're going to see it's just taken as a string and nothing more. more. But what we want to do is we want to use this helper that's going to allow us to render this raw HTML. And we're just going to use at HTML. And as you see, we are all set with this element. Now, we got to be really careful when using, you know, at HTML or we're rendering out HTML because we need to sanitize this. And there's a lot to be said about that, but it's a little bit out of the scope of this video. So just know we really have to trust what we pass in here. But overall, this is super easy to use, a really cool aspect of Svelte, and I hope you found it useful. So if you did, go ahead and give us a thumbs up and I will see you in the next one.
