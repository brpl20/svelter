 How's it going everybody? Welcome back and let's talk about reactivity with arrays. So as you see we're using code from earlier, nothing crazy, very simple. And what we're first gonna do is we're gonna create a button and we're gonna try to remove a fruit from the fruits array. So let me create a button tag and and I'm going to say remove a fruit. We're not going to style this button at all, all right? We're just going to keep it really easy for this example. And we're going to use the onclick handler. We're going to put an arrow function inside, and we are going to do fruits.pop. Okay, great. So let me go ahead and save this. We do see our button here. And when we click remove a fruit, as you see, nothing happens. And that is because whenever you want reactivity with an array you need to reassign that variable to a new array So we going to have to we don really have a choice we have to turn this into let from const. And what we're going to do, and let me just kind of pop this open here. What we're going to do is we are going to reassign fruits and we're going to spread this and then we are all set. So let me go ahead and save that and let's go ahead and run through this. So now you're seeing the fruits disappear and be removed properly from the UI because we are reassigning the fruits variable here to a new array. Now, this is going to change in Svelte 5, and everyone's really excited about it, but you are going to see this in the wild, so it is good to know. All right. Thanks, everyone. I'll see you in the next one.
