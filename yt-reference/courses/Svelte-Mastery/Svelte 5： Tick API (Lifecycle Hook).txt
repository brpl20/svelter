 Hey everyone, welcome back and let's talk about a really important lifecycle hook and that is going to be the Tick API. And so what we love about Svelte is that we don't need to worry about the DOM updating. There's so much magic under the hood with Svelte that it kind of just abstracts away a lot of that complexity. Now, if you need to confirm that the DOM has been updated, right, because all of these DOM changes, right, There's a ton of reactivity on the screen. They get kind of batched into these particular updates, right, to really kind of optimize what's happening. Now, if you need to confirm that the DOM has been updated, and there's really kind of two major reasons for this. So let's say you're working with a derived value and you need to make sure that that derived value has been, you know, fully updated, or maybe you're kind of doing a bit of a UI change in the HTML or inside the DOM. Well, this is going to do this for you. And so this is going to return a promise and that kind of important to keep in mind But with this you can essentially work with that promise to then do something with your code after everything has been updated So in the past if I needed to grab a DOM element or an HTML element inside the DOM, this has been a great way to confirm that that change has been made, and then we can go do something with that element. So we're inside the docs here, and this is what it says. While there's no after update hook, you can use Tick to ensure that the UI is updated before continuing. Tick returns a promise that resolves once any pending state changes have been applied or the next micro task if there are none. So that's something to keep in mind. This is really handy. So if you are programming and something isn't right, kind of the timing is off, you know, kind of consider tick and that is going to serve you well. So I hope you found this video useful. If you did go ahead and give us a thumbs up and I will see you in the next one.
