 Hi everyone, so in this video we're going to look at component props, which comes from Svelte, which is like a TypeScript helper function for types, and how to use it to get the props, the types of the props of a component. Basically, here when I'm declaring leaf, I have these four, this is my type, or my interface, and how do I, when using the leaf and other components, how do I get the types of the props? So you'll see here in the page, I import leaf so that I can use it. And then by doing component props and then these brackets type of leaf, basically I get this thing right here. And then what I'm doing is adding an ID number onto it. So that way when I push to my leaves, I can do ID, left, and rotate. If I remove rotate, it's going to yell at me because rotate is required. But current and outduration are not required, so I don't have those. But if I made one required, say current, then it'll complain. The other thing is to get a specific... If I just want one of these, for example, current, I can then take this leaf type, basically take this, and then just reference current there. And then I'll know that my state can be either falling, flaming, or raking. So if I remove that, it's not going to like it. Okay, that's some TypeScript fun for you. Have a nice day. Goodbye.
