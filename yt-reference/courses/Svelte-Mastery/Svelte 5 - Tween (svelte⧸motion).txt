 Hi everyone, so in this video we're going to take a quick look at tween, which is in Svelte Motion, and it's a little bit different from Svelte 3. So what that does is, basically when you have a number and you want it to kind of animate in like that, so rather than just directly snapping to that. So what you want to do is import tween from Svelte Motion, and then you'll create a variable like this, new tween. It's a class, so you can just use const. We're just setting properties on the class, of which there are two you need to know about. One is target. So target is basically keeping track of the value of the tween. So when I make this fault and then rake, I'm setting it immediately to 49. which is target. So you'll see target, target. So when I set it, I'm setting target plus equals leaves dot length that I just raked. So immediately target will become 49, even though it animates to it. So the other value that is not target is current, which is the number that is being animated. So I add 10 to it, it immediately becomes 69, but the current will, not slowly, but move towards in between this value and the new value. So that's current, and target is the actual value. so I hope that helps and have a good day goodbye
