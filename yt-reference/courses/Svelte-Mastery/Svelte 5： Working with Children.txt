 Hey everyone, welcome back and let's quickly talk about working with children in Svelte 5. And so this is really the syntax. We're destructuring children from props and then all we're doing is using that at render tag to display the children, okay? And we need to use those parentheses there to get those children on the screen. Okay, so now that we're all set here kind of with that syntax, you're going to see that we're not working with any children with this component. And so if we want to go ahead and kind of work with children at like a really basic level, let's just go ahead and say, hello, everyone. Perfect. And let's go ahead and kind of close out my component. So you're going to see that this indeed is being represented inside this component here, which is great. And so now that we have that and we have a little bit of a conditional statement right here. Let's go ahead and work with snippets. And snippets is something that we can really take advantage of and we can pass them to our components in Svelte 5 So I really liking this syntax here So let go with snippet I just going to say test I sure there a better naming convention that I can use, but it doesn't really matter. And let's just say, wow, this is, oops, let's go back. This is nice. Okay. So let's go ahead and just kind of close this out and then we will be all set. Okay. Perfect. So now that we have this, let's go ahead. I'm going to kind of refactor this into kind of a self-closing tag. All right. And then all we are is just using children props and I'm going to pass in test just like that. And as you see, we're passing that snippet into our component and then it's being rendered out. So that's just like a really basic example, but hopefully it gives you a better understanding and updates your mental model on how we can really use components in a flexible way. So I hope this helped. If it did, go ahead and give us a thumbs up and I will see you in the next one.
