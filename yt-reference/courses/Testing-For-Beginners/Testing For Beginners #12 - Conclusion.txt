 So I hope you learned a lot. This is enough to get you started, but there's a lot of other questions and test cases you might have such as how do I test an API. Take an example the newsletter you can subscribe to below. You wouldn't use the real API because it might be slow or if it's not working it might break your test. Look into using the mock service worker instead. As for other resources, I highly recommend reading everything from Ken C. Dodds on his blog including testing and common mistakes with React testing library.
