 So let's test the to-dos left. So if you go to our app, this is our component, how many items are left. So if we complete some to-dos, we can see changes and that's what we're going to test. So let's go back here and add the test. So you can say to-dos left test ts. You can close it. the same as before let's specify a path source components this is left test ts and that should be all right so if you look here we're going to add a helper function again and these are going to be our tests which are going to be relatively simple but first let's import the component Let's create a helper function render to use left. It takes in an incomplete to use prop that's going to default to 4. And then we're going to say props are the incomplete to use. And let's render the component, to-do is left, and then let's just spread the props and return them. So now let's write the test. So you can say test, should display how many incomplete to-do's are left. Pass it the normal function And then let render the todos left Render todos left We're just going to say forward to be explicit, even if we say it's a default. And then we're going to query it. But first let's import it, right? Always forget this. Screen get by text. Text, not test ID. And then it should say four items left, right? And our test should pass. So let's add the other test. Should say one item left, if there is only one to do. So if we render to do's left and we specify one, then we can query by text and it should say one item left instead of one items left then we can run that test and it passes awesome so now we can test if it works for items should say two items left if there is more than one to do item So you can pass function, say render to this left. We can say two, then we can say screen get by text, two items left, right? And a test should be passing. So this was really short.
