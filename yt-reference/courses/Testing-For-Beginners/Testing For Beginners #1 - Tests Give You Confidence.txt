 Hey friends! Today I'm excited to share with you the super long title, Testing User Interfaces for Beginners Regardless of what JavaScript Framework you're using. So let's get into it! So tests give you confidence. Testing is a subject I feel severely lacks great content and might seem like the black art to the uninitiated just because of that. I want to make testing more approachable and show you how even it can be fun. So we're going to learn how to test any front javascript framework to have more confidence in our code in this example we're going to use the swell to do app we built from the previous post make a swell to do app right here that you can learn how to make yourself if you want and use a swelt but don't worry because it's well don't think it doesn't apply to you because what you're going to learn today is going to be using the testing library that's framework agnostic and works for all the popular front to javascript frameworks so testing is important because it gives you confidence your code works as expected and if you test your application as your users you know their experience is predictable so imagine if you had a piece of code that other things are lying and you have to add a feature or a factor how it works so this might remind you of the nightmare of editing css that's like global in your project right where you don't know what's going to break if you change one part of it and that's literally how it is without tests so you can use tests to prevent people from submitting code in a pull request that would otherwise break things and in the same way encourage contributions because you don't have to test it yourself and it's automated instead. In the next one we're going to build our own testing framework so join me in the next one.
