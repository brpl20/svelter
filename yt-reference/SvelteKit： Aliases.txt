 Hey everyone, welcome back and let's talk about aliases. This is something that's really going to help your development process and it doesn't take a lot of setup. So an alias is going to allow us to drill into our folders properly, but they're kind of like shortcuts or bookmarks if you want to think of it like that. Now we actually get an alias out of the box and that's $lib and that's just going to reference this folder right here, okay, inside of our source folder. Now, let's say we want something like this, right? We want a path or kind of like a shortcut just to drill right into our components folder. Now, the moment I do this, we're going to get an error, obviously, because we haven't already set up this alias. and if I go to my side project, right, just the, you know, I'm just spinning up this server here, you're going to see that we obviously get an error. So all we have to do is we have to go into our svelte file and let go ahead and add that alias And sure enough cursor already knows exactly what I want So let me go ahead and save this And let go ahead and get all this restarted. And let's take a quick look here. Okay, so we are back. And as you see, Our application is running again, which is great. And so once again, an alias is going to allow us to drill into a particular folder. And we can even have more aliases. Now, I'm not going to use these as complete examples. But as you see, like all of the aliases that Cursor is recommending, like utils, routes, I've seen at routes quite a bit in other applications. and we can go ahead and set those up and we can just really improve our import statements at the top of our Svelte components. So I hope you found this video helpful. If you did, go ahead and give us a thumbs up and I will see you in the next one.
