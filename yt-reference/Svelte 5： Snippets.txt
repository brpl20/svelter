 Welcome back everyone and let's quickly talk about snippets, a new feature in Svelte 5. And so right here we are defining a snippet and if you're used to using Svelte or you have some experience, you're going to see there's a little bit of an overlap in between like if logic right here, like when we're rendering out an if statement in the HTML, it opens with a hashtag and it closes with a slash. So there's a little bit of overlap there. So it's kind of familiar in a sense, but we're going to be using an entirely new keyword snippet and we're going to be naming that snippet. And then we have the opportunity to pass something in. So this is kind of like a component on the fly, which is really nice. And just remember, you can't have multiple components in one file in Svelte. So this is kind of their answer for this, which is really great. Because if you think about it, a lot of this code, it should live in this file. You know, this is going to avoid creating a new component importing it referencing it And so this is a really really fantastic and lightweight approach And so I am rendering this snippet with a render tag And as you see, I'm just kind of iterating with, you know, in each block and just passing in that individual item there. And so this is really, really useful, as you can see. But take a look at this. if I go ahead and I go ahead and just add, you know, a message right here and let's go ahead and quickly define this and we'll just say maybe life is good. OK, perfect. And you're going to see that this has a very similar scope to a function, right? It has the ability to work with variables that are defined in the same scope. and so message right there is no problem and that's something to consider as well when creating snippets so i hope you got something out of this this is the absolute basics of snippets and if you did go ahead and give us a thumbs up and i will see you in the next one
