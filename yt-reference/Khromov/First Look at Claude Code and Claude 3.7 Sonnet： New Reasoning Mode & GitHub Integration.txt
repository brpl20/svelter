 So just a short moment ago, Anthropic dropped a bunch of updates, and I thought it would be super cool to do a quick first look at all of the new features that were released. So let's just dive into it. The biggest thing that they launched is Cloud 3.7. So that's a new model, or rather say an upgraded model of their existing Cloud 3.5 version 2 or whatever they call their latest model before this. So what's really exciting about this model is that it is actually like a model that can do reasoning and also not do reasoning. So if we go into the Cloud app, we see here that we can choose it from the drop-down menu. So we have access, of course, to the existing 3.5 version, and now we also have the 3.7. And this model has two options for you. You can use it in a normal mode, which is, I think, equivalent to the regular mode on 3.5. And there's a new extended mode that you can actually use and the extended mode does something very similar to OpenAI's 01 model where it will like reason for a while before it gives you an answer. So let's try the classical father and son riddle with the extended mode here and see if it manages to get the correct answer. There we go and so you saw here that it provides you with the thinking steps here that it did and then you will get the answer out. And this also, as per their introduction post, this also works really, really well for coding. Now the second feature I want to highlight is something that is buried a little bit down in the blog post, which is that we now have GitHub integration on the regular cloud plan. So I think that before they had it on the enterprise plan, but now as a normal person, you can sign up for the pro plan and get the GitHub integration. So let's have a look at how that looks. So again we'll start here at the prompt and let's go ahead now and go to this GitHub icon. So the first time you click here it's going to ask you to authenticate with GitHub and then go to the GitHub site, you approve it and then from then on you have the integration going. Now what you can do with this integration is that you can pick a repository. So let's say I'll pick this repository, which is a library that I've been working on recently, and you will get the content of the repository. And you can basically select which files you want to include for the question. So what we can see here is that it's not very smart, right? By default, it will not filter out files that might be, for example, very large or stuff like if you're using Node.js, stuff like package lock, which isn't very useful to include in the context. But let's say I will go ahead and and include basically taking all of my project files, I will press add files, and now it's gonna take a little bit of time, it's gonna kind of compile them down into a blob. There we go. And now I can ask something like what does this application do Let see what it comes up with All right and then it talks a little bit about what this application is which is a debugging tool for self called Svelte Render Scan, and everything is completely correct. Now what I have noticed is that this feature doesn't really work for projects right now. Like I would kind of expect to be able to add something here and maybe even have it like automatically update in the background. That doesn't seem possible right now. It just seems like you are able to kind of add it to the current conversation, but not really to the project as a whole. And so when it comes to kind of including large code bases, I don't think that this new method is super convenient. Like it's really nice that it exists, makes it super easy to look things up from your repos. but if you want to continuously upload all of your code and keep track of what you include and not include, I would still recommend this library that I made a while ago called AI Digest that you can check out a separate video on that I'll link somewhere here. There are a bunch of these libraries for a bunch of different languages so you just pick one and it packages down all your code into one file and you can upload it into your project or as part of a conversation. So really really easy. So the third thing that was added, which I'm extremely excited about, is Cloud Code, which is their kind of take on agentic coding. So we have a bunch of these tools out. Klein is a very popular one. There's a bunch of extensions for VS Code that help you out. This is their kind of tool. It is IDE agnostic. Let's try it out. Let's see how it works and let's see if we can build something with it. So unlike these other features that we talked about, which were on the kind of consumer side, where you could use the Cloud website or the Cloud app, Cloud Code is more on the sort of API side of things. So in order to use Cloud Code, you actually have to set up the Anthropic console. And this is a pretty easy thing if you haven't done it before. You basically connect like a credit card and then your usage doesn't come through your monthly subscription, but instead you pay as you go when you use the API. And so this new tool, Cloud Code, it uses the API. So let's have a look and see how you can get started with it. So you can kind of read here their setup, but basically you need Node.js, you need Git, and you need like GitHub and or GitLab if you want to do the included PR workflows. So let's have a look at this and let's fold instructions and let's see if we can get this going in a project. So I will fold instructions here and I will open up an existing project I have. Let me just install the new Cloud CLI here and then navigate into your project folder which you already did. And then now let's go ahead and just run Cloud So if this is the first time you running it it gonna ask you to go in your web browser to a special URL We gonna connect it to the Anthropic console That a one step takes only a few seconds And then it gonna let you select like a theme and a few other like settings. But I already did that. So it just throws us right into our project. So first, let's have a look at this project that we have. It's an extremely simple app. I thought like I wouldn't go too crazy with this first demo. It's an app where you can enter your name. It's written in SvelteKit and it kind of gives you a little bit of a loading screen and then it gives you your name back so there's like a little bit of a delay just to show off the loading effect. All right, so now we're in here and let's see if it can figure out what sort of app this is. What does this app do? I'll ask it. And now we see the agentic coding, right? So it's figuring out which files it's going to read. It's trying to figure out the different functionality, and now it says this app is a simple greeter form that demonstrates a loading indicator for SvelteKit form submissions. Perfect. So let's try to write a new feature, and I thought that, you know, what is something basic you could do? You could ask it to redesign it. So let's ask it to help me redesign this app in the style of a 90s GeoCities site, a retro design. And then let's see what it does with that. So it's gonna think, it's gonna do the agentic coding and then it's actually gonna suggest which changes it wants to do and actually do them. This is the cool thing about the Edge and Decoder that it's actually going to write changes onto the file system right away. And you see here, it shows me a little preview here, a little diff of what it wants to do. So it's doing quite a lot because just because I asked it to do like such a big thing. But okay, let's say like, yes, do these changes and don't ask me again, just go ahead. and now it's gonna it's gonna do those changes let's see here it's still working and yes it because it is a file aware it also separately made changes on the server endpoint for the form there we go yes still going and now it's asking me if it can run a command I mean I guess I'm not sure why it wants to do that but let's try it maybe maybe it can't read all the folders maybe it needs to figure it out by checking the directories here we go so it did all these changes let's see let's how it looks whoa wow this is really quite something all right let's see if this thing still works all right all right uh there we go it's beautiful uh it's really it's really something with the marquee here and everything all right and what what's cool about this is is you know You can obviously do follow stuff to this You can say I prefer more of a blue color than purple and then it going to kind of suggest something different and hopefully here we will see that it can make also smaller changes and not as big changes. So it's suggested let's see to change one color here in this file and then some other colors in this separate file. Yeah so what's really cool also is it's working across all the files in the project. This project isn't that big but still it's finding a bunch of stuff. Okay, so since I already approved it to make changes to my files, it went ahead and just changed it and yeah we can see that things are a lot bluer now than they were before. Another thing I noticed is that it tried to include like some images here that I think maybe it hallucinated or maybe they don't exist anymore. Remove all usage of images, so let me just ask it to take those away. All right, it thought for a little bit and yep, it removed the images. We can see here in the diff that it deleted this background images that it was using. So that seems to have worked okay too. Now what's interesting now is that what did all of that cost, right? So because we're using the API and it's hitting the API, there is costs involved with this. Now they write in their blog posts that it can cost like something like five to ten dollars an hour with kind of like not so heavy usage, that can be correct. But if you're using it a lot, it can get quite expensive. But we can take a look in the console here and see what actually happened here. So let me go to the console. And first, let's have a look at the logs. So the CLI tool is working in a special workspace called Cloud Code. We can also see the way it consumes token. So it seems to send quite a big chunk of your code to Claude, and then it seems to do it several times for each request you make. So I think it could get quite expensive with big projects, but hopefully it's smart enough to kind of pick out the most important pieces. Okay, so practically, what did that cost? We can see here that today I spent 69 cents, and I think when I started this video I had spent something like 20 or 30 cents so just those few requests took about yeah like 40 cents or something like that and we weren't going for that long so I think you can imagine that that adds up in the end. I think everyone has to decide for themselves which is the most efficient workflow for them but I do really recommend checking this new tool out like it's available it's out right now you can try it in your existing projects and see how it works. Those are the three big things that were released just now. We have Sonnet 3.7, Cloud Code, and the new GitHub integration, which is available for all Pro users. I'd love to hear your thoughts specifically about Cloud Code, and maybe if somebody has worked with Klein and similar tools, they can kind of compare and let me know how it compares to those tools. Thanks so much for watching. I look forward to bringing a lot more content around Cloud and Anthropic. See you in the next video.
