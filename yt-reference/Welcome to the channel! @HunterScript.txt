 Hey everyone, welcome to the channel. I'm Hunter Stephens, a software engineer from Houston, Texas, and I've had the privilege of working with people from all around the world to build web applications. So, so many software engineers have helped me in my personal journey. They've been patient, they've given me tips, they've really helped me improve my skill set, and I'm trying to do just that in this channel. I'm going to be breaking down our code in the smallest form so that we can all understand what's actually going on. Now, what's really important is that we build up our mental models piece by piece, and hopefully we can do that through these videos. So if you have a particular piece of technology that you'd like me to cover, if it's in my scope of knowledge, I'd love to make a video on that. So just kind of, you know, signal that in the comments, but thanks so much for checking out the channel and hope to see you around.
