 Yo listen up, I'm the Svelte Architect Dropping knowledge about version 5, it's time to reflect Runes of the future, they're changing the game Fine-grained reactivity put the others to shame State-derived effect, that's how we roll Universal reactivity, taking full control No more top-level left, no more dollar store Rooms make it explicit, you know what you're coding for Sibits over slots, more flexible and clear Event handlers as props, the syntax disappears Components as functions, no more class confusion Svelte 5's got the tools for your coding evolution Migrate with ease, no need to stress Backwards compatible, we've got you, I confess But once you see runes, you'll never go back Svelte 5's upgrade, that's right on track So level up your code, embrace the runes Svelte-5 the framework that makes your app zoom The future's bright but the journey's just begun With Svelte-5 and Runes, coping's never been this fun
