 Once again, hello and welcome people of Svienna. Great to have you in your office today. Happy anniversary to Svienna. I heard it's the one year anniversary. Yeah, very much looking forward to the talks already. Yeah, just very briefly before we get started with the actual talks, I'm just going to tell you what century is basically. And yeah, just briefly before that, my name is Lukas. I work at Sentry here for about one and a half years by now. I mostly work on the JavaScript SDKs. So together with the front-end SDK team, I took care of maintaining a few, I think it's 15 or something like that, JavaScript SDKs that we have. For example, Angular React, but also more recently Svelte and SvelteKit. So yeah, what is Sentry all about? We are a application monitoring product. So we started out with errors, basically meaning we catch errors that happen on your users devices. We gather as much information as possible about them and then we send them to Sentry so that you can take a look as a developer and see what caused the error, how we got how they got there and ideally how to fix it quickly. More recently, we also started performance monitoring so that you can basically identify which parts of your app might be a little bit slower and might need to be sped up a little. And then also very recently, we started out with session replay and with other products products like crunch of monitoring or profiling. So a few application monitoring products all along. important we are open source so you can just go to our github repositories and basically everything we do is out in the open and we really love working together with the community of various platforms and frameworks and whatever century is basically free you can self-host it and just install the entire application on your servers or if you don't like the hassle of that and the countless hours of maintaining these things you can decide to give us a little bit of your money And we are going to take care of that for you Yeah this is just a small overview of a portion of the frameworks and languages that we support and you can see here a few javascript ones um a lot of the backend frameworks as well in different languages like java php python you name it basically um also some mobile applications and platforms like android ios flutter um yeah all this good stuff this good stuff and also some gaming engines like for example unity uh yeah so since we're here today to talk about svelte i figured let's just quickly take a look at how to use uh century in a svelte kit application and this is basically our newest sdk so we just released this a few weeks ago basically and it's super easy to get started you just run our central wizard to install the sdk and the wizard will take care of downloading the svelte package it will lock you into century to connect your local project with a century project and then it will take care of actually initializing the project so it will add some codes to your files so how does this look on the client side we use the client hooks provided as felt kit we initialize the sdk first and give it some options like for example a dsn to tell century uh to tell the sdk basically where to send all the data to then um yeah you can add some other options to it like for example our session replay integration and we also use certain hooks provided by svelte kits such as the handle error hook on the client hello and yeah that's basically all the codes you need for getting it run on the client even less code in the server basically we use a few more of um svelte kits hooks like for example also the request handler which is super awesome and as the last part we also have a wheat plugin that you install to yours um to your wheat config and it's this century cell fit plugin um you can use this to add some more of our auto instrumentation to your cell kit application so this will um bring performance monitoring and to all your load functions for example but you don't have to configure them individually and you can also use it to upload source maps automatically to to set it that sorry to century yeah that basically it just a few lines of codes then you deploy your application to wherever you hosted and soon afterwards probably some kind of issues are going to appear assuming we not perfect developers. And yeah, this is basically just a list of issues as they come to century and we can take a look at one of them now. So here we can see the kind of error, where it happened on Chrome, mac os some additional metadata basically for example i think the user data should be somewhere in here um and yeah we can also take then a look at the stack trace um important to point out here this is the already unminified stack trace so you can i previously set your upload source maps to century so we basically take care of unminifying your minified code that you ship to your client and we try to give you um the exact location where the actual the actual error happened in your code uh yeah then you get some more context around what happened before the arrow was thrown so for example breadcrumbs here that show a navigation event then the user clicked something then xhr request went out we have some additional statistics where these errors occur most frequently and yeah basically just as much data and information as possible for you for developers to um yeah find out why this error happened and how to fix it with performance monitoring um we try to basically for example for browsers or for web applications we give you um web idols so lcp for example or fcp and we collect these values over time so that you can see how well your app performs on your actual clients devices so um not like if you would run it on lighthouse where it basically runs on your device mostly under good conditions or under simulated bad conditions but on your actual users devices and to see how your apps perform there uh yeah so in a more in a greater detail um in the performance uh product you can also take a look at actual traces meaning you can check if you have a page load for example like here um you can check what happened so first a few browser requests and some resources were loaded and yeah later on underneath here some other requests happened basically and the good thing is here you can also connect this basically to your entire application stack by a distributed tracing so you can also see which kind of API requests for example were triggered from your front end from your browser here if you went to a Django application the back end and then that application again made some database calls and you really see what actually might be causing here some sort of performance problem like a slow query or query or n plus one queries something like that cool uh yeah as i said uh already uh we basically started out with session replay a few months ago so this is kind of our uh newest shining feature on the front end side and uh the idea here is to provide a video like session of a user session that you can really see how your users experience the session experience your web application firsthand and how do we get this to work it's basically just three lines of code as i said earlier already you have you add the replay integration first you give it a sample rate so that you basically tell the sdk how many of all user sessions that happens happen should actually be recorded in center century and yeah just those three lines we deploy our app again and let's just pretend this is an actual session this is one of our colleagues navigating the central ui we can see they make a few clicks here they navigate through the different tabs here and let's take a look at this replay how this looks as a replay so here we can see basically the video player um this shows us that session that we just watched um we took great care of basically being privacy first so all the text for example is redacted by default and you can opt in them to the things that are safe so that we don't expose any um customer or client data by accident and some additional stuff here as well like for example breadcrumbs or uh overview basically a condensed timeline into the user session and yeah that's basically all it is thank you very much uh for having us and one last request since i actually work on this velkit sdk's um if you guys by chance have already used them or if you're planning to use them feel free to reach out to us and we're always very keen on getting feedback always happy to respond to some get-up issues or on our discord whatever you prefer and yeah thank you
