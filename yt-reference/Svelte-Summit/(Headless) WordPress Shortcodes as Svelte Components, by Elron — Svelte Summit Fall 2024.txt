 Hi everyone! My name is Elroan and I create fun and useful tools for creators at fanweb.io. As you can see, most of the tools are made for Hebrew users, but some of the tools are created also in English. Today I'm excited to share with you one tool that I created that inspired me to create a new library called Svelte WP Shortcodes. Few years back, my main way to build a website was using WordPress. That made me happy because I had full control over my website look and feel because I could customize the code. For the same reason, today I love using SvelteKit. One of the key things I love about WordPress is that it's a CMS, a content management tool. So basically, it lets you be able to edit some content, save it, and when the page is shown to the user, he's going to see something different, more designed. But what happens if you want to have an interactive component like a contact form or a YouTube video? If the article was written in SvelteKit, it would be really easy. You would just do something like this and have the interactivity in this component. In WordPress, you would do something a little bit different. You would go ahead and install a thing called plugin. This, for example, Contact Form Serpent is a plugin that lets you create forms So if we go to the plugin you see this code It called a short code What it lets you do is you can copy it and go to the page you want, just paste it in. And now if we save it and open it, it's gonna show the form and it also has interactivity. When I was creating my Svelte app, Confetti page, I had so many tutorials to write, but I didn't want to write any of them. I wanted to hand it off to someone else. But the problem is, she didn't know how to code. That's why I used WordPress as a headless CMS. That way, she can use the visual editor to create the content, and then I would render it through SvelteKit. So this is the headless WordPress. You can see all the tutorials are written over here. And what SvelteKit does is it fetches all the information from the headless WordPress and presents it like this. Now I want to show you a magic. If you go inside one of the tutorials, you'll see the content, but it also has interactivity, like this YouTube video, or for example, this play button. How is it possible? Well, you know the answer already. I use shortcodes, of course, but not WordPress shortcodes, but Svelte shortcodes. I'm going to you exactly what I mean. If we edit this page you can see it has these shortcodes. For example, YouTube and Svelte knows that I want it to be presented like this play button and when you hover you have this black effect and when you click on it it's going to play the video. You can see I created a youtube component If we go down you can see that if it played then it going to show the iframe which is the embed of the YouTube video and the V is replaced by the same variable we placed in the shortcode. And if we didn't click on play yet, it's going to show the play icon. One piece of the puzzle is the WordPress shortcode, and the second piece of the puzzle is the SvelteKit component. The question I ask myself is how do I integrate both of these into one piece? So as you can tell, that inspired me to create a new library called Svelte WordPress Shortcodes. It's really straightforward to use the library. I'm going to show you how. Let's go ahead and open the demo. First of all, we're going to import the library. And we're going to use the component like this. It's going to accept two key value pairs, components and markup. Markup is basically the text that we received from WordPress. But as you can see, you don't need to use WordPress to use this. You can just use a string and it will work. The second key is components. And you're going to see a map over here. So high, the high, this one, is going to be replaced with the svelte component high button, which is this one. Note, you see over here, is going to be replaced with the note svelte component. And you see, this shortcode has a text inside, right? What happens then? Well, it's going to be rendered as a slot inside note. For YouTube, you can see we have key value pair of ID and some random text. You can use any key value pairs you want like this I decided it will be ID but I can just say video instead But then I would need to update it over here. To get a better understanding on how this works, let's go inside the HighButton component, this one. And we're going to see that when we press High, it's going to alert High just like we specified over here. Now let's make it a little bit more interesting. Let's say inside the WordPress we want to create a shortcode that you can edit the message of the alert. What would you do then? Let's create a new shortcode. The new shortcode is going to be called alert button. It's going to say amazing and inside the button I want to present this text. Now this shortcode doesn't do anything yet. You can see it's just presented as plain text. In order for it to be rendered, we need to specify the name of the shortcode and the component is needed to be imported and it's going to be paired with this shortcode. A load button isn't defined yet, so let's create the component. Now nothing is rendered. So first of all let's put the slot and the slot is presented. Now we want to wrap it with a button. Add an event on it. Now we added the event and we're going to add say. Now when we click on it it's going to say amazing because that's what it is. That's all for the demo. If you want, you can try it out and play around. Thank you so much for watching. I hope this helps and if you want to reach out, ask me something, chat, I'm here.
