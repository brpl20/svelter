 How's it going, everybody? Welcome back, and let's talk about reactive conditional statements. Now, this is super cool. It's like Svelte is doing all of the work for us, and I think you're really going to like this. So right off the bat, we have code that we've seen before, nothing crazy, and I am going to use some Svelte magic here, right? That dollar sign. Remember, every time we see that dollar sign, something cool is going to happen. And we're going to go actually right into an if statement. So if fruits.length is, we'll say, less than 3, what we're going to do is we are going to add an alert. Okay? And this alert is going to say, wow, we removed a fruit. okay nice and easy let me go ahead and save that and once we remove a fruit right from logic that we've seen before we have the alert and it's really cool because when we add the dollar sign colon and we make this a reactive conditional statement the svelte compiler is watching for the fruits dot length to change. So it's doing all of the heavy lifting for us and it's super easy to use. So I hope you found this useful. If you did, go ahead, give it a thumbs up and I will see you in the next one.
