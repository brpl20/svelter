 The time is now for container queries in Svelte. Container queries are like a very smart, more powerful media query. Whereas media queries apply to the entire viewport, container queries apply to specific elements. So first off, I have this box with a red border. The test container has a width and a height of 200 pixels. If you specify container type on any element, the test element or anything with the test class will have a container type of inline size. That allows line 49, the container query, to do its magic. If the width is below 400 pixels, then these classes and these rules will apply. So on line 51, flex direction column is already applying to the flex parent. But down here, we have a second flex parent. The only difference is this is nested inside a red bar. But down here, it's nested inside the main element. So because the main element is greater than 400 pixels, it's using a flex direction of row. That is the default on line 47. If I decrease the width to less than 400 pixels, now it is a column, flex direction column. The point here is that this box is already below 400 pixels, so the container query applies. Whereas this one is just responsive because it depends on the size of main, which is dynamic.
